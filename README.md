# Udacity Machine Learning Nanodegree
# Project #3: Student Intervention

## Introduction
This is a project for Udacity's Machine-Learning Nanodegree. It uses reinforcement learning techniques to train a virtual smartcab to navigate through a city safely and efficiently.


## Concepts and Classes
Concepts explored in this project:

  - Reinforcement learning techniques like Q-learning
  - Markov decision processes
  - State spaces

## Getting Started
To view the project, open `report.html` in a web browser.

To view the GUI and watch the cab learn over time (takes a while), navigate to the top directory and execute the following command:

`$ python smartcab/agent.py`
